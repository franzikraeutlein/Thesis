# Thesis
The Repository contains the code for preprocessing and analyses as applied in my thesis.

Scripts getData_EEG and getData_OPM were used to transform the output of the LSL stream to raw data files and to set the annotations correctly.

Clean_data_EEG and clean_data_OPM were used to preprocess the data.

get_Power performs multitaper analysis on data of each subject and saves the power files

Cluster_based_permutation_test was used for statistical analysis with Cluster-based permutation test. Moreover, Figures of the identified significant clusters are generated.

SNR_analysis_and_plot performs the SNR computations and plots the results.

plot_descriptive_Figures was used to generate Figures of time-frequency spectra and PSDs
